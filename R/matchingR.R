#' @title matchingR: Efficient Computation of Matching Algorithms in R
#'   and C++
#' @description matchingR is an R package that efficiently computes the 
#'   Gale-Shapley algorithm for both the stable marriage problem and the college
#'   admissions problem, Irving's algorithm for the stable roommate problem, and
#'   the top trading cycle algorithm for large matching markets. The package 
#'   provides functions to compute the solutions to the stable marriage problem,
#'   to the college admission problem, the stable roommates problem, and the 
#'   house allocation problem.
#'   
#'   The package can be useful when the number of market participants is large
#'   or when very many matchings need to be computed (e.g. for extensive
#'   simulations or for estimation purposes). The Gale-Shapley function of this
#'   package has successfully been used to simulate preferences and compute the
#'   matching with 30,000 participants on each side of the market.
#'   
#'   Matching markets are very common in practice and widely studied by
#'   economists. Popular examples include
#'   
#'   the National Resident Matching Program that matches graduates from medical
#'   school to residency programs at teaching hospitals throughout the United
#'   States the matching of students to schools including the New York City High
#'   School Match or the the Boston Public School Match (and many more) the
#'   matching of kidney donors to recipients in kidney exchanges.
