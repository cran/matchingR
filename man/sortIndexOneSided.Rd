\title{Ranks elements with column of a matrix, assuming a one-sided market.}
\usage{
sortIndexOneSided(u)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{A matrix with agents' cardinal preferences. Column i is agent i's
preferences.}
}
\value{
a matrix with the agents' ordinal preferences
}
\description{
Returns the rank of each element with each column of a matrix. So, if row 34
is the highest number for column 3, then the first row of column 3 will be
34 -- unless it is column 34, in which case it will be 35, to adjust for the
fact that this is a single-sided market.
